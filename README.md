## What is this?
Optimize-partition is a micro-framework for optimizing objective functions defined over partitions using the genetic algorithm.
The problem solved here is finding the best partition of a set given an objective function defined over partitions of the set.
The number of partitions of a set grows very rapidly as the set grows, so it is in general intractable to examine all
partitions to find the best one.  The genetic algorithm is used to focus the search.

## Main Features

## Dependencies
optimize-partition uses the Java implementation of the genetic algorithm provided by Apache Commons Math
